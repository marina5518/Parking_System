# :red_car: Parking_System

## :question: About
This project demonstrates an Automated Parking System that count vehicle entry and exit in a parking lot with a maximum capacity of 9 cars. It uses logic circuits, IR sensors, and a servo motor for gate operation. The system also prevent overcapacity and provides user feedback via a buzzer when the parking lot is full.

## :sparkles: Features
- count vehicles entry and exit.
- Automate gate operation using a servo motor.
- Block vehicle entry when the parking lot is full.
- Provide an audible warning when the parking lot is full.
